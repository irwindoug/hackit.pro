      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/191818-960ed4-3f7cac-e6f04b" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/191818-960ed4-3f7cac-e6f04b</a>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary" style="color: white;">[#191818]</td><td class="secondary">[#960ed4]</td><td class="accent1">[#e6f04b]</td><td class="accent2">[#fffcff]</td></tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: IBM Plex Serif  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I wanted to keep with the format of my logo, which is a Serif font, along with utilizing a font that is more aligned with a programming font style. Since IBM is very closely tied with programming, I decided to go with it!  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Ubuntu  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Also going along with my programming font style theme, but I wanted to differentiate between headers and text. I therefore went with a sans-serif font style for my paragraphs, as it is more eye appealing when reading larger amount of text.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.
